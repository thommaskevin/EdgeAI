## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to explore the deployment of advanced AI models on edge devices, emphasizing:

- Reduced computational complexity  
- Compression and quantization techniques  
- Lightweight fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA)  
- Integration with embedded systems and sensors  
- On-device RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
